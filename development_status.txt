Implemented:
	-Enter VR
	-Rendering with 2 cameras
	-Head rotation
	-Stereoscopic 3D
	-Head MOVEMENT
	-Reset HMD position	
	-Scale values which depend on meters as unit



Not yet implemented:

	-Latency testers (min, max, average):
		* XML3D finished rendering -> submitFrame
		* getPose -> XML3D uses pose
		(current time deltas...)
	-FPS counters (min, max, average, current)
		* XML3D
		* HMD
	-Controller Support
		* XBOX One Controller
		* Vive Controller?
	-User movement with collision detection
	-FOV integration
	-Synchronize XML3D Rendering with "Snapshots" taken by HMD
	-Fix for new Chromium Version
	-Buttons for leaving VR
	-Dynamically create buttons

Christian:
	-Add the plugin to xml3d-examples (https://github.com/xml3d/xml3d-examples) and test with the scenes there
	-Test with a large scene (ie. kingsx from xml3d-demos). Also test with the broken texture build of xml3d.js
	 since that should have much better fps (at the cost of broken textures)
	-Try stats.js for fps measurements, Chromium dev tools Profiler and Timeline features to find bottlenecks
